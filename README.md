# Graph-Analytics-and-Community-Detection
Community Detection using Graph Analytics for Marvel's comic book characters
data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mauryansshivam/marvel-comics-1500-characters-and-their-appearance
Graph Analytics using igraph-python and community detection using leading_eigenvector algorithm.

Exploration of graph properties:
 - graph diameter
 - graph density
 - Degree centrality - #of direct ties with other nodes
 - Closeness centrality - how close a node is to all other nodes in the graph
 - Betweenness centrality - the fraction of shortest paths passing through each vertex
 - Eigenvector centrality - Measures “who” (not just how many) it is connected to; high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes
 - Page Rank - a special case Eigenvector centrality
 - edge_betweenness - how often the vertex [edge] lies on the shortest path between pairs
